# Munin

Munin is a note-taking library and knowledge base written in Lua. It is named after one of [Odin's ravens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huginn_and_Muninn) in Norse mythology and means "memory" in Old Norse.

## Plans

Notes will be added to a SQLite database. They will support various tagging and categorizing functionality. The full-text search capabilities of SQLite will allow users to search through notes easily.

A CLI will allow users to interact with the library via the command line instead of programatically.

A [Neovim](https://neovim.io) plugin will allow users to interact with their notes in a more user-friendly interface.

The ability to export the notes as a static site may also be added, allowing users to host their notes on the web.
